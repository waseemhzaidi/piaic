 * Assignment Q-10: Adding Comments: 
 * Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. 
 * If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, 
 * just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
